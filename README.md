# geartify
## Hi there 👋
Faceless tech unboxings, where I try not only to unbox and showcase the product, but also demonstrate practical use cases, how customers can use it, and provide valuable insights with every video.  

I actively contribute to my <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v9/icons/youtube.svg" width="24"> [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@geartify), <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v9/icons/instagram.svg" width="24"> [Instagram](https://instagram.com/geartify_), and <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@v9/icons/tiktok.svg" width="24"> [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@geartify).

## About

I make videos because I have always loved tech, and I want to share that fascination with others. With my videos, I try to **unleash the beauty of technology** and bring practical value - showing use cases or examples that help viewers understand how a product can be used.  

I enjoy exploring how technology evolves and am always curious about what’s next. Through my videos, I aim to translate my initial impressions and first experiences into a calm, structured, and valuable viewing experience. My channel is not just ASMR-style unboxings - it’s about **experience and value** for the viewers.

## Philosophy (Why I make videos)

I have always loved tech, and through my videos I try to **unleash the beauty of technology**. I enjoy bringing practical aspects into my videos - whether it’s demonstrating real-world use cases or providing examples of how products can be used. This helps showcase the product in a meaningful way.  

I am fascinated by how technology evolves and am always curious about what’s next. Through my videos, I try to share my initial impressions and experiences, and provide viewers with more than just unboxing content - I aim to bring both **experience and value** into each video, beyond simple ASMR-style presentations.

## Sponsorships

I accept sponsorships sparingly and only with companies or small businesses that I have personally interacted with, either through direct communication or personal use/interest in their products.  

### Sponsor Vetting
I am selective about sponsors and will never promote anything that I consider scammy or not valuable to viewers.

### Paid Videos / Product Showcase Videos
I never produce paid videos where a sponsor pays me to provide commentary. My videos are faceless, and all information is presented visually or via text overlays. Sponsored products are always clearly disclosed and chosen based on genuine interest and relevance.

### Affiliate Links & Referral Programs
I participate in **Amazon Affiliates**. Purchases through these links give me a small commission at no extra cost to you, which helps support the channel and future content. Only products I personally find useful or interesting are linked.
